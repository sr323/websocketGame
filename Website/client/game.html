		The script calls here should be all here.
		The script calls should start and stop the different canvas', for example
		stopping the single player canvas, returns to menu, which then allows the user
		to click multiplayer. 
		
		Would be easiest to have an image with html buttons over the picture for menu buttons
		which allow the user to select options, the buttons have their own javascript actions.
